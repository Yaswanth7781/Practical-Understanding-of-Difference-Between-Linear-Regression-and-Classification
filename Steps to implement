Dataset:
Use the Iris dataset (available in sklearn). This dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica), each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Exercises:
Exercise 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
1. Load the Iris dataset and display the first 10 rows.
2. Display the distribution of each feature (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) using histograms.
3. Choose two features for a regression task (e.g., "sepal length" vs "sepal width") and visualize the relationship using a scatter plot.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).
Exercise 2: Implement Linear Regression for Regression Task
1. Train a Linear Regression model to predict one feature (e.g., sepal width) using another feature (e.g., sepal length) from the training set.
2. Plot the regression line over the scatter plot to visualize how well the linear regression model fits the data.
3. Evaluate the model’s performance using:
o Mean Squared Error (MSE)
o R-squared (R²) score
Exercise 3: Implement Logistic Regression for Classification Task
1. Modify the dataset to perform binary classification (choose two classes such as "Setosa" and "Versicolor").
2. Train a Logistic Regression model to predict the class labels (Setosa or Versicolor) using one or more features.
3. Visualize the decision boundary of the logistic regression model using a 2D plot of the selected features.
4. Evaluate the classification model’s performance using:
o Accuracy
o Precision, Recall, and F1-score
Exercise 4: Compare Linear Regression vs Logistic Regression
1. Compare the outputs of Linear Regression (from Exercise 2) and Logistic Regression (from Exercise 3):
o Linear Regression outputs continuous values, which may be outside the range of [0, 1] (in case of classification).
o Logistic Regression outputs probabilities between 0 and 1, which are interpretable as the probability of belonging to a specific class.
2. Discuss the differences in:
o Interpretation of outputs: How do the outputs of both models differ, and how can this affect the decision-making process in classification tasks?
o Appropriateness: When should you use linear regression vs logistic regression for similar tasks?
Exercise 5: Visualize and Analyze the Performance
1. For Linear Regression:
o Plot the predicted values against the actual values (sepal width vs predicted sepal width).
o Visualize the residuals (differences between predicted and actual values) to analyze model fit.
2. For Logistic Regression:
o Plot the decision boundary to show how well the model separates the two classes (Setosa vs Versicolor).
o Plot the confusion matrix and discuss the model's performance in terms of false positives, false negatives, precision, recall, and accuracy.
Bonus Exercise: Scaling and Performance Comparison
1. Normalize or standardize the feature values.
2. Re-train both the Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models after scaling the features.
3. Compare the performance of both models (without scaling vs with scaling) and discuss how feature scaling impacts the models.
