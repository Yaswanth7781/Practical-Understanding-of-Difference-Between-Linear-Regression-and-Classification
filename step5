1. OUTPUT COMPARISON
Linear Regression (from step 2)
Goal: Predict continuous values (e.g., sepal width from sepal length).
Output: Real numbers (like 2.54, 3.12, etc.)

Not suitable for classification because:
  Output isn’t bounded between 0 and 1.
  May predict negative or >1 values when misused for binary classification.

y_pred_linear = model.predict(X_test)  # Continuous outputs like 2.8, 3.4

2. LOGISTIC REGRESSION (from step 3)
Goal: Predict class membership (e.g., Setosa or Versicolor).
Output: Probabilities between 0 and 1 (can be thresholded to predict class).

Suitable for classification.

probabilities = logreg.predict_proba(X_test_bin)[:, 1]  # e.g., 0.92, 0.13
predicted_class = logreg.predict(X_test_bin)  # e.g., 1 or 0

Table: Summary of Output Differences
 Model	                Output Type	          Range	    Use Case
Linear Regression	     Continuous values	   (-∞, +∞)	  Regression
Logistic Regression	   Probability	         [0, 1]	    Classification

Final Conclusion
Use Linear Regression for predicting quantities.
Use Logistic Regression for binary or multi-class classification, where you care about class probability or decision boundaries.
